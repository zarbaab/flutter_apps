# BMI Calculator

This Flutter application serves as a **prototype interface** for a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. Currently, it displays an organized layout with gender selection, height and weight inputs, and reusable widgets, but it does not perform the full BMI calculation functionality yet.

## Features

- **Gender Selection**: Choose between Male and Female options.
- **Interface Design**: Basic layout with height and weight input sections.
- **Reusable Widgets**: Uses `RepeatTextAndIconWidget` for cleaner and more modular code.

> **Note**: This app is primarily a UI prototype. While it provides an interface for BMI calculation, full functionality has not been implemented.

## Code Structure

The app structure is organized using a reusable widget named `RepeatTextAndIconWidget`. This widget accepts a label and an icon as parameters, helping reduce code redundancy and keeping the layout modular and clean.
